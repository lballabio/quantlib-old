The convention for the names of release tags used to be Rxxyyzzln where:
R stands for Release
xx is the major number
yy is the minor number
zz is the minor-minor number
l  can be a,b,f for alpha, beta, final respectively; 
   for 0.x releases f is the only choice that makes sense
n  is an ordinal number; 0 is only allowed when l equals f

e.g. R010300a2 stands for Release 1.3.1a2
     R000501f0 stands for Release 0.5.1

Since QuantLib 1.3, the tags are more readable. However, the above is
still used in the code to check the version programmatically.

The current version number is 1.8 - R010800f0

This version number needs to be updated manually in:

    QuantLib/Announce.txt
    QuantLib/configure.ac
    QuantLib/ql/version.hpp
    
    QuantLib-SWIG/configure.ac
    QuantLib-SWIG/SWIG/ql.i

    QuantLibXL/framework/QuantLibXL.xla
