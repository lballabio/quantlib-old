The convention for the names of the CVS branches is Rxxyyzzln where:
R stand for Release
xx is the major number
yy is the minor number
zz is the minor-minor number
l  can be a,b,f for alpha, beta, final respectively; 
   for 0.x releases f is the only choice that makes sense
n  is an ordinal number; 0 is only allowed when l equals f

e.g. R010300a2 stands for Release 1.3.1a2
     R000501f0 stands for Release 0.5.1

The current version number is 1.4.2 - 010402f0
