The current version number is 1.8; the hexadecimal version is 0x010800f0.

The version number needs to be updated manually in:

    QuantLib/Announce.txt
    QuantLib/configure.ac
    QuantLib/ql/version.hpp

After modifying configure.ac, running ./autogen.sh and ./configure
will update the version number in any other file that needs it.
