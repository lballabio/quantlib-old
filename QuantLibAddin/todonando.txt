======= TODO ===============

---
GENERAL
- everybody please:
  be ready to debug DevCycle revisions
  switch to boost 1.34.1 (bjam --toolset=msvc-8.0 install)
  familiarize with ohObjectSave() ohObjectLoad()
  familiarize with ohPropertyNames and ohPropertyValue()
  stateful serialization
  check out and compile SA
  pricing engines are (the only) mkt data observers
  SVN config file
  pricing engines refactoring
  verbose log messages

- CabotoXL.xla (Murex curve, vol export, cms calibrations, cms book)
- serialize RelinkableHandles and Pricing Engines
- more release manager
- bund future equivalent
- multicallable
- RT stop
- touch timestamp-buildnumber file
- MultiPhaseLeg (no overlapping cf, payer only), MixedLeg (with payer/receiver)
- check cf sorted by amount too
- addFixings(TimeSeries)
- expose QL::TimeSeries and QL::IndexManager to QLO/XL
- use Handle<Quote> to switch from a set of mkt data to another set
- weakness: redemption is not granted to be the last flow
- build number
- clean up qlo\xxx.hpp files from ql inclusions
- rename onForwardCmsPrice
- remove qlo/simplecashflow.hpp
- review with Eric BlackCalculator/BlackScholesCalculator (and remove default
  constructor)

- use ValueObject for x,y interpolation persistance?
- fix bug XS0093295953 PropertyValue("Coupons")
- perche' SABR interpolation ha un data member forward_
- remove bat from testsuite/bin
- avoid ignoring class of files, as in *.suo
- where is qlcalendar advance in the wizard
- RateHelpers refactoring (using indexes)
- get FuturesRateHelper in line between QL and QLA
- change QLA::DepositRateHelper as in QL::DepositRateHelper
- refactor QL::Bond so that it expose its leg to be used by QL::Cashflows,
  avoiding Bond methods that are doing nothing else than forwarding to
  QL::Cashflows
- cubic parameters as input to PiecewiseYieldCurve
- caplet/swaption calibration
* just one test with multiple unit-test
* check new cotsmm corr and old one
* use more realistic corr structure in test suite
  verify yc bootstrapping
  check corr times includes all rate times but the last
  check original calib result before deleting it
  object wizard does not paste InterpolationTraits
  1D as default value instead of exampleValue in hist corr
  check displacements
* market model creation from calibrator
  check if homo = false still crashes
  first rate issue (i.e. when a solution does not exist)
  duplicate pseudorootfacade checks in the new constructor
  multiple displacements for swap indexes
  check if iterative approach make it worse when there is a failure
  check/enforce alpha_i > 1/t_i
* conditional formatting on calibration errors in 1Y wbk

K

- presa in carico del foglio di Clerici
- mostra De Nuccio standard di mercato di vanilla swap/swap/cap&floor

  volStructures (K and Giorgio):
  -> YC=False ha impatto sulla costruzione del cubo 30x30,
     lo swap che fissa tra 30Y e ha durata 30Y ha come last date una
     date superiore alla max date della yc
  -> cube=False: same results in trms of npv

     use RunAutoMacros.
