- Additional Credit functionality exported from %QuantLib to %QuantLibAddin.
  Thanks to Jose Aparicio.
- Bug fix.  In the past, if you called function qlSimpleQuoteSetValue() with an
  invalid value, the call failed.  This led to bugs, if you opened a
  spreadsheet with stale rates, a quote could be set with an input that was
  numerically valid but out of date.  Then if the live value was #NA, the update
  failed, leaving the quote with an old stale value.  Now, if you call
  qlSimpleQuoteSetValue() with an invalid input such as #NA, the quote object is
  invalidated.

<strong>Release 0.3.13 - August 2006</strong>

%QuantLibAddin 0.3.13 is a major release comprising a several fold increase
in the size and complexity of the application.  The project has also been
restructured as summarized below.

QUANTLIBXL

The name QuantLibXL was originally applied to an Excel addin which supplemented
%QuantLib releases 0.3.3 through 0.3.8.  That project was discontinued.

%QuantLib releases 0.3.10 and later have been accompanied by a release of
%QuantLibAddin.  All %QuantLibAddin releases have included an Excel addin.
Beginning with %QuantLibAddin version 0.3.13, the QuantLibXL name has been
resurrected and given to the %QuantLibAddin build for the Excel platform.  The
new QuantLibXL project reflects the fact that the majority of interest in
%QuantLibAddin originates from end business users on the Excel platform.  The
new QuantLibXL project has a separate web page 
(<a href="http://www.quantlibxl.org">http://www.quantlibxl.org</a>)
and provides a Windows installer for the compiled package.

GENSRC

gensrc (<a href="http://www.gensrc.org">http://www.gensrc.org</a>) is a Python
application which takes XML descriptions of functions defined in a library and
generates source code for addins on supported platforms including Microsoft
Excel and OpenOffice.org Calc. gensrc is used to autogenerate source code for
%QuantLibAddin and ObjectHandler.

gensrc was previously called srcgen, and resided in a subdirectory of
%QuantLibAddin versions prior to 0.3.13.  gensrc has been separated from
%QuantLibAddin 0.3.13 into a standalone project.  gensrc has adopted the
version numbering scheme from ObjectHandler, hence %QuantLibAddin 0.3.13
relies on gensrc version 0.1.4.  gensrc was renamed from srcgen because of a
conflict with another SourceForge project.

REQUIRED PACKAGES

- %QuantLib version 0.3.13
- ObjectHandler version 0.1.4
- gensrc version 0.1.4

FUNCTIONALITY

- 146 new functions / 227 in total

  categories:

    pricingengines, processes, randomsequencegenerator, ratehelpers, 
    schedule, shortratemodels, simpleswap, swap, swaption, 
    swaptionvolstructure
- Support for Value Objects (Plamen Neykov) (see ObjectHandler
  documentation for details)
- Numerous refinements and enhancements to the design including:
  - Lower-level access to %QuantLib functionality such as Handles
  - Support for "permanent objects" which aren't deleted by garbage
    collection
  - Richer function interface including better support for enumerated
    datatypes, object references, datatype conversions
