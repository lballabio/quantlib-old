Workaround for a glitch in Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (*.chm) files.

When the chm file is compiled, the only images that are detected are those that
appear in html.  Images that appear only in css files are excluded from the chm
file.

This file explicitly lists images required by file ql.css, forcing their
inclusion in the chm file.
