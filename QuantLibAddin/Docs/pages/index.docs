\section idx_overview Overview

%QuantLibAddin exports the functionality of the
<a href="http://quantlib.org">QuantLib</a> C++ analytics library to a variety
of end-user platforms including Microsoft Excel and LibreOffice Calc.

<div class="center"><img src="images/screenshot.png"></div>

The Excel implementation of %QuantLibAddin is packaged for end users as the
<a href="http://www.quantlibxl.org">QuantLibXL</a> project which provides
\li An installer for the addin
\li Business documentation
\li Example workbooks

The scope of the %QuantLibAddin project includes
\li Implementations for platforms other than Excel
\li Downloads and tutorials for compiling %QuantLibAddin/QuantLibXL from source
    code

\section idx_components Components

The %QuantLibAddin application comprises
\li QuantLibObjects, a library which wraps %QuantLib classes in a format which
    allows them to be stored in <a href="http://www.objecthandler.org">ObjectHandler</a>
\li An interface configured in XML from which
    <a href="http://www.gensrc.org">gensrc</a>
    generates source code for Addins on supported platforms

\section idx_features Features

Features of %QuantLibAddin include
\li <b>Object Orientation</b> - %QuantLib objects may be constructed,
    interrogated, updated, passed as arguments to other functions, and destructed.
\li <b>Polymorphism</b> - For example, function \c qlNPV() returns the NPV of
    an \c Instrument and may be invoked on an instance of any derived class such as
    \c Swap or \c Bond.
\li <b>Portability</b> - The same interface is implemented in platform neutral
    C++ and is available on all supported environments.
\li <b>Serialization</b> - A pricing environment may be created in Excel
    workbooks and transmitted to a Linux process for calculation.
\li <b>Coercion</b> - The value which the user inputs to a function may be one
    of a number of datatypes and any necessary conversion is performed
    automatically.
\li <b>Enumerations</b> - Minor or transient types are represented by a
    registry of string/value pairs, for example \c "PUT" indicates \c
    QuantLib::Option::Put.
