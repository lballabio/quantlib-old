/*! \file gsrprocess.hpp
    \brief GSR model process with piecewise volatilities and mean reversions,
           the dynamic is expressed in some T-forward measure.
           You may provide a single value for the mean reversion, then
           it is assumed to be constant. For many grid points (like 20 and above)
           evaluation may get slow. A caching is therefore provided.
           By that the results become inconsistent as soon as the parameters
           change. In that case flushCache() must be called. To ensure correct
           calibration this is done in the generateArguments() of the GSR model
