//! Inverse cumulative random number generator (multithreaded)
/*! It uses a uniform deviate in (0, 1) as the source of cumulative
    distribution values.
    Then an inverse cumulative distribution is used to calculate
    the distribution deviate.

    The uniform deviate is supplied by RNG_MT.

    Class RNG_MT must implement the following interface:
    \code
        RNG_MT::sample_type RNG::next(int threadId) const;
    \endcode

    The inverse cumulative distribution is supplied by IC.

    Class IC must implement the following interface:
    \code
        IC::IC();
        Real IC::operator() const;
    \endcode
