//! A transformation of an existing inflation swap rate.
/*! This is an abstract class and contains the functions
    correctXXXRate which returns rates with the seasonality
    correction.  Currently only the price multiplicative version
    is implemented, but this covers stationary (1-year) and
    non-stationary (multi-year) seasonality depending on how many
    years of factors are given.  Seasonality is piecewise
    constant, hence it will work with un-interpolated inflation
    indices.

    A seasonality assumption can be used to fill in inflation swap
    curves between maturities that are usually given in integer
    numbers of years, e.g. 8,9,10,15,20, etc.  Historical
    seasonality may be observed in reported CPI values,
    alternatively it may be affected by known future events, e.g.
    announced changes in VAT rates.  Thus seasonality may be
    stationary or non-stationary.

    If seasonality is additive then both swap rates will show
    affects.  Additive seasonality is not implemented.

        can be an inconsistency with quoted instruments.
        Alternatively, the seasonality can be set _before_ the

//! Multiplicative seasonality in the price index (CPI/RPI/HICP/etc).

/*! Stationary multiplicative seasonality in CPI/RPI/HICP (i.e. in
    price) implies that zero inflation swap rates are affected,
    but that year-on-year inflation swap rates show no effect.  Of
    course, if the seasonality in CPI/RPI/HICP is non-stationary
    then both swap rates will be affected.

    Factors must be in multiples of the minimum required for one
    year, e.g. 12 for monthly, and these factors are reused for as
    long as is required, i.e. they wrap around.  So, for example,
    if 24 factors are given this repeats every two years.  True
    stationary seasonality can be obtained by giving the same
    number of factors as the frequency dictates e.g. 12 for
    monthly seasonality.

    \warning Multi-year seasonality (i.e. non-stationary) is
             fragile: the user <b>must</b> ensure that corrections
             at whole years before and after the inflation term
             structure base date are the same.  Otherwise there
             can be an inconsistency with quoted rates.  This is
             enforced if the frequency is lower than daily.  This
             is not enforced for daily seasonality because this
             will always be inconsistent due to weekends,
             holidays, leap years, etc.  If you use multi-year
             daily seasonality it is up to you to check.

    \note Factors are normalized relative to their appropriate
          reference dates.  For zero inflation this is the
          inflation curve true base date: since you have a fixing
          for that date the seasonality factor must be one.  For
          YoY inflation the reference is always one year earlier.

    Seasonality is treated as piecewise constant, hence it works
    correctly with uninterpolated indices if the seasonality
    correction factor frequency is the same as the index frequency
    (or less).
