The most notable changes are included below.
A detailed list of changes is available in ChangeLog.txt.


PORTABILITY

- Enable successful compilation with Boost 1.58 and either gcc or clang.

  (thanks to Giorgio Pazmandi).

DATE/TIME

- Added Moscow Exchange calendar (thanks to Dmitri Nesteruk).

- Added 70th anniversary of anti-Japanese day to Chinese calendar
  (thanks to Cheng Li).

- Fixed Chinese New Year date for 2010 (thanks to Cheng Li).

- Added nearest-trading-day business day convention (thanks to
  Francois Botha).

- Prevented normalization of a 7-days period to a 1-week period, since
  this doesn't apply to business days (thanks to Paolo Mazzocchi).

- Allowed schedules built with a vector of dates to be used for coupon
  generation, given that the required information was provided (thanks
  to Peter Caspers).

- Added support for Australian Security Exchange (ASX) dates (thanks
  to Maddalena Zanzi).

- Added ECB dates for April and June 2016 (thanks to Paolo Mazzocchi).

INSTRUMENTS

- Extended digital American options to handle knock-off case (thanks
  to Riccardo Ghetta).

- Extended barrier options to handle KIKO/KOKI barriers (thanks to
  Riccardo Ghetta).

- Added Ikeda/Kunitomo engine, binomial engine and binary/digital
  engine for double-barrier option (thanks to Riccardo Ghetta).

- Added Bachelier engine for caps/floors based on normal volatility
  (thanks to Michael von den Driesch).

- Allowed non strike/type payoffs in finite-differences engine for
  vanilla options (thanks to Joseph Wang).

- Fixed settlement days of BTP bonds.

- Fixed generation of schedule for OIS and vanilla swaps.

- Added support for ASX dates to futures rate helper (thanks to
  Maddalena Zanzi).

MODELS

- Moved Markov functional model, GSR model, Gaussian 1D model and
  related engines, processes and term structures from the experimental
  folder to the code library (thanks to Peter Caspers).

CASH FLOWS

- Added CMS-spread coupons, including digital (thanks to Peter Caspers).

INDEXES

- Added CMS-spread index (thanks to Peter Caspers).

- Fixed day-count convention for Fed Funds rate.

TERM STRUCTURES

- Fixed bug where a valid previous curve state could be a bad guess
  for the next and lead to a bootstrap failure.

- Allow negative adjustment for futures rate helpers (thanks to Paolo
  Mazzocchi).

VOLATILITY

- Added support for normal and displaced lognormal volatility to
  optionlet stripper (thanks to Michael von den Driesch).

- Allowed calibration of the alpha of the SABR model to the ATM point
  while keeping beta, nu and rho fixed (thanks to Peter Caspers).

- Added Chambers-Nawalkha implied-volatility approximation (thanks to
  Peter Caspers).

- Added displaced lognormal swaption volatilities (thanks to Peter
  Caspers).

- Allowed the optionlet boostrap to continue if one caplet can no be
  matched (thanks to Peter Caspers).

- Added flat-extrapolation option to swaption ATM volatility matrix
  (thanks to Peter Caspers).

- Implied swaption volatility cube for Gaussian 1-D model (thanks to
  Peter Caspers).

MATH

- Allowed user-defined Jacobian in optimization (thanks to Peter Caspers).

MISCELLANEA

- Added IDR, MYR, RUB and VND currencies (thanks to Lucy King).

DEPRECATED FEATURES

- Removed deprecated methods and constructors from the
  BlackVarianceTermStructure, BlackVolTermStructure,
  CapFloorTermVolatilityStructure, DateParser,
  FittedBondDiscountCurve, GeneralLinearLeastSquares, Handle,
  LocalVolTermStructure, OptionletVolatilityStructure, Settings,
  SwaptionVolatilityStructure and VolatilityTermStructure classes.

EXPERIMENTAL FOLDER

The ql/experimental folder contains code which is still not fully
integrated with the library or even fully tested, but is released in
order to get user feedback.  Experimental classes are considered
unstable; their interfaces might change in future releases.

Changes and new contributions for this release were:

- Finite-difference meshers based on multi-dimensional integrals
  (thanks to Klaus Spanderen).

- SVI interpolation and a corresponding smile section (thanks to Peter
  Caspers).

- ZABR volatility model (thanks to Peter Caspers).
