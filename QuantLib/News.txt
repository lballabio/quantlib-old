Changes for QuantLib 1.4.1:
===========================

QuantLib 1.4.1 is a compatibility release. It fixes a number of
compilation errors that surfaced when using QuantLib 1.4 with
Clang 3.5 and Boost 1.57. Thanks to Tim Smith for the heads-up.

If you are not using Clang, you don't need to upgrade from
QuantLib 1.4 to 1.4.1.
