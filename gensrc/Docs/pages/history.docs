<strong>Release 0.9.7 - November 2008</strong>

- Fix bug in gensrc internal error handling
- In autogenerated source code files, generate a comment to indicate which stub
  file was used

<strong>Release 0.9.6 - September 2008</strong>

- More flexible validation of type/supertype combinations in function metadata
- Autogeneration of some additional source code files relating to
  ValueObjects
- Support for enhancements in ObjectHandler where type boost::any

  parameterized

<strong>Release 0.9.0 - January 2008</strong>

- Autogenerate source code for Addins supporting serialization
- Better support for autogeneration of source code for C++ addins
- Better support for autogeneration of source code for looping functions
- Fix deficiency in gensrc which necessitated the duplication of ObjectHandler
  function metatdata in QuantLibAddin
- All function parameter names must now begin with an uppercase letter,
  this is for compatibility with the Excel Function Wizard

<strong>Release 0.8.0 - May 2007</strong>

- Every line of code reworked, many algorithms improved
- Implemented gensrc as a Python package
- Datatype metadata factored out of function metadata into separate
  file types.xml
- Refined the Rule algorithm which generates source code for a given
  function argument

<strong>Release 0.2.0 - February 2007</strong>

- multiple small fixes in support of changes in syntax of QuantLibAddin
  and ObjectHandler source code

<strong>Release 0.1.5 - December 2006</strong>

- extended Rule class to allow algorithms to be applied recursively
- consolidated redundant RuleGroup class into Rule
- implemented support for autogeneration of source code for "loop"
  functions - an Addin function which receives its input as a vector,

  and returning a vector of results

<strong>Release 0.1.4 - August 2006</strong>

- Decoupled from QuantLibAddin into standalone project

Previous incarnations of gensrc were bundled with QuantLibAddin
releases 0.3.10 - 0.3.12.
