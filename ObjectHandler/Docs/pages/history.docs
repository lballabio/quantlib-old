Renamed Addin Functions:

The convention for naming addin functions is that an addin function which
wraps Foo::Bar() should be called ohFooBar().  Selected functions have been
renamed as noted below to conform to this convention:

- ohCollectGarbage   -> ohRepositoryCollectGarbage
- ohConcatenate      -> ohStringConcatenate
- ohDeleteAllObjects -> ohRepositoryDeleteAllObjects
- ohDeleteObject     -> ohRepositoryDeleteObject
- ohListObjectIDs    -> ohRepositoryListObjectIDs
- ohLogAllObjects    -> ohRepositoryLogAllObjects
- ohLogMessage       -> ohLogWriteMessage
- ohLogObject        -> ohRepositoryLogObject
- ohObjectCount      -> ohRepositoryObjectCount
- ohPropertyNames    -> ohObjectPropertyNames
- ohPropertyValue    -> ohObjectPropertyValues
- ohRetrieveError    -> ohRangeRetrieveError
- ohSetLogFile       -> ohLogSetFile
- ohSetLogLevel      -> ohLogSetLevel
- ohSplit            -> ohStringSplit

New Addin Functions:

- ohLogFile
- ohLogLevel
- ohObjectClassName
- ohObjectIsOrphan
- ohObjectIsPermanent
- ohObjectUpdateCounter

Enhanced Addin Functions:

- ohObjectPropertyNames - Modified to suppress ObjectId, ClassName from return
  value and to list values in the sequence in which they appear in the
  constructor of the corresponding class.
- ohObjectCreationTime, ohObjectUpdateTime - Implemented as loop functions.

Renamed C++ Functions:

Within the C++ code, some functions are renamed as well to conform to project
standards (http://quantlib.org/style.shtml).  These changes are transparent to
end users.

<table>
<tr><td><b>Class</b></td><td><b>Member - Old Name</b></td><td><b>Member - New Name</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>ObjectWrapper</td><td>reCreate()</td><td>recreate()</td></tr>
<tr><td>Repository</td><td>formateID()</td><td>formatID()</td></tr>
<tr><td>Repository</td><td>exists()</td><td>objectExists()</td></tr>
<tr><td>Repository</td><td>isObjectExists()</td><td>objectExists()</td></tr>
<tr><td>SerializationFactory</td><td>NewObject()</td><td>recreateObject()</td></tr>
<tr><td>SerializationFactory</td><td>createObject()</td><td>restoreObject()</td></tr>
<tr><td>ValueObject</td><td>getRelationObs()</td><td>getPrecedentObjects()</td></tr>
<tr><td>ValueObject</td><td>processRelatedID()</td><td>processPrecedentID()</td></tr>
</table>

REQUIRED PACKAGES

- Boost version 1.34.1 or later
- log4cxx version 0.10.0b
- gensrc version 0.9.7

<strong>Release 0.9.6 - September 2008</strong>

DESIGN

- Type boost::any is replaced with boost::variant as the latter offers
  native support for boost::serialization (thanks to Plamen Neykov)
- New class Processor facilitates stateful serialization of Objects
  (thanks to Plamen Neykov)
- Additional logic to ensure that, when an Object is retrieved from the
  Repository, if the Object is older than any of its precedents then
  it is recreated before being returned to the client application
- New functions ohObjectCreationTime(), ohObjectUpdateTime(),
  ohObjectPrecedentIDs(), ohConcatenate()
- Class SerializationFactory cleaned up and consolidated

BUILD

- Introduce support for VC9.  Drop the SingleThread configurations from the VC7
  build as these are no longer supported by log4cxx.
- When compiling under Linux, rather than using relative paths to locate
  gensrc, the path is now specified with a mandatory argument to the configure
  script:
\verbatim
./configure --with-gensrc=/path/to/gensrc
\endverbatim

DOCUMENTATION

- Installation document revised and expanded
- Fixed bug which caused chm files to hang

LOG4CXX

- Migrate from log4cxx 0.9.7 to log4cxx 0.10.0
- A customized build of log4cxx 0.10.0 is packaged for use with
  %ObjectHandler and released as version 0.10.0a.  The convention for log4cxx
  version numbers is explained below in the notes for %ObjectHandler version
  0.1.4.
- log4cxx now relies on the apr and apr-utils applications, which are included
  with the log4cxx 0.10.0a package.

REQUIRED PACKAGES

- Boost version 1.34.1 or later
- log4cxx version 0.10.0a
- gensrc version 0.9.6

<strong>Release 0.9.0 - January 2008</strong>

DESIGN

- Support for serialization
- Port Enumeration Registry from QuantLibAddin to %ObjectHandler, allowing a
  single global registry to be shared by multiple client applications
- Instantiate instances of class Object with a single call to the ctor.
  Previously, objects were initialized in 3 steps - a call to the constructor,
  followed by 2 additional calls to set various object properties.
- Implement new parameter Overwrite for all constructors, a boolean flag
  allowing user to specify that new object should overwrite old one
- Extend ohDeleteObject() to accept a list of object IDs
- Introduce new class Group which stores a list of object IDs
- ohObjectCallerAddress(), ohObjectCallerKey() - accept/return vector<string>
  instead of string
- Optimize error handling for looping functions.  Previously, an exception in a
  loop with many iterations caused a big performance hit.
- Introduce basic support for caching of error messages originating from VBA
  addins.

LOG4CXX

- A couple of minor fixes to makefiles
- Repackaged as version 0.9.7e.  The convention for log4cxx version numbers is
  explained below in the notes for %ObjectHandler version 0.1.4.

REQUIRED PACKAGES

- Boost version 1.34.1 or later
- log4cxx version 0.9.7e
- gensrc version 0.9.0

<strong>Release 0.8.0 - May 2007</strong>

%ObjectHandler has been rewritten for release 0.8.0.  The chief benefit
is an orders-of-magnitude increase in performance.  See below for a summary
of other changes.

DESIGN

- Every line of code reworked, many algorithms improved
- Renamed class %ObjectHandler to Repository
- Renamed namespace ObjHandler to %ObjectHandler
- New class ObjectXL customizes the base Object class for the Excel platform
- New class Xloper performs RAII for Excel's XLOPER datatype

EXCEL

- New functions ohObjectCallerAddress(), ohObjectCallerKey(), ohRetrieveError()
- Fixed problem of error handling malfunctioning for non-English versions
  of Excel.  Error handling is based on range references in R1C1 format,
  %ObjectHandler now caters for versions of Excel which abbreviate "R"ow
  and "C"olumn differently.
- Removed restriction that %ObjectHandler functions could not be nested
  inside non-%ObjectHandler functions.
- Fixed bug whereby %ObjectHandler functions could malfunction if
  the text length of the cell formula exceeded a certain length.  This problem
  was traced to a glitch in the Excel C API and a workaround was identified.
- For function expecting a scalar, allow user to pass in a vector
  containing one element and convert it automatically.

DOCUMENTATION

- The comments in the code have been brought completely up to date.  As a
  result the  doxygen-generated documentation of classes and code is also up to date.
  Much of the other hand-written documentation still requires an update.
- \c Topics page of documentation renamed to \c Manual and updated to provide
  overview of major design features

LOG4CXX

- Consolidated export of Excel functions
- Increased granularity and clarity of runtime exceptions
- Improved memory management (automatic deletion of temp variables)

LOG4CXX

- Link to log4cxx statically rather than dynamically.  The use of log4cxx.dll,
  introduced in %ObjectHandler version 0.1.2, was found to destabilize
  %ObjectHandler and so the static link to log4cxx, used in %ObjectHandler
  version 0.1.1, has been reintroduced.
- We now provide a zip file for log4cxx, comprising a complete copy of log4cxx
  plus some customizations to clarify the build process and other minor bug
  fixes.

<strong>Release 0.1.2 - October 2005</strong>

EXCEL

Excel binding ported from QuantLibAddin to %ObjectHandler
and enhanced:

- %ObjectHandler core functionality and the Excel binding can be
  linked statically into a single client XLL, or built as a standalone
  XLL comprising a global repository shared by multiple client XLLs
- Garbage collection of objects orphaned by the deletion of the
  calling cell
- Conversion to/from all Excel types and native C++ types
- Greater granularity of datatypes - XLOPER replaced by OPER, FP

LOG4CXX

- Link to log4cxx dynamically rather than statically
