Contributing
============

Contributing is easy. Get a GitHub account if you don't have it
already and clone this repository with the "Fork" button in the top
right corner of this page. Check out your clone to your machine, code
away, push your changes to your clone and submit a pull request;
instructions are available at
[https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).
(In case you need them, more detailed instructions for creating pull requests are at
[https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests),
and a basic guide to GitHub is at
[https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).)

It's likely that we won't merge your code right away, and we'll ask
for some changes instead. Don't be discouraged! That's normal; the
library is complex, and thus it might take some time to become
familiar with it and to use it in an idiomatic way.

We're looking forward to your contributions.
