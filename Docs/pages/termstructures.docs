/*! \defgroup yieldtermstructures Term structures

    The abstract class QuantLib::YieldTermStructure provides the common
    interface to concrete yield-rate term structure models. Among
    others, methods are declared which return instantaneous forward
    rate, discount factor, and zero rate at a given date. Adapter
    classes are provided which already implement part of the required
    methods, thus allowing the programmer to define only the
    non-redundant part.
