<h1 align="center">QuEP 6: Currency, Money, and Exchange Rates</h1>
<div align="center">Joel Nelson</div>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This is a proposal to enhance QuantLib with a new module for
handling currencies, money, and foreign exchange. The
implementation follows closely the OMG Currency specifications
(<a href=
"ftp://ftp.omg.org/pub/docs/formal/00-06-29.pdf">ftp://ftp.omg.org/pub/docs/formal/00-06-29.pdf</a>),
but not to the end of being 100% OMG compliant. In addition to new
classes, some of the current functionality relating to "date-time"
and "amount of time" concepts are extended to meet the needs of the
currency module.</p>
<h2>Current implementation and Disadvantages</h2>
<p>This is an add-on enhancement for missing functionality more
than it is an extension of any current implementation. Currency
only exists as an enumeration of some ISO currency codes. Apart
from this, there is are no abstractions of "currency", "money", or
"exchange rates" available from within the library.</p>
<p>A Date abstraction exists in the QuantLib::Date class and
contains a pretty complete "date" implementation. However, it has
no "time" component for representing "date-time". Another potential
limitation is that "date" is a single, concrete class. By adding an
abstract class containing the "date-time" interface, the
implementation would be freed up and others could be added
(Strategy pattern). The current implementation is based around a
date serial number (as in Excel) that must be manipulated to
produce the date in any other form. While functionally correct, it
is can be a drag on performance. Providing a Date-Time abstract
class instead of just wrapping QuantLib::Date allows us to add new
Date and DateTime implementations as needed.</p>
<p>"Amount of time" exists as QuantLib::Period, but the
implementation is limited to a specific use. It can hold a "unit of
time" as an integer, but can not convert between units.
Furthermore, once a Period object is constructed, it can not change
precision. For example, if the Period object is created to hold
weeks it can not deal with an amount of time such as "2 weeks, 2
days, 12 hours". It can handle some of the functionality needed to
hold an "amount of time", but it isn't as flexible as the OMG
DAmountOfTime object. QuantLib::Period is fine for what it
represents, but the library needs the functionality in AmountOfTime
as a complimentary class.</p>
<h2>Proposed implementation</h2>
<p>Following the OMG spec, the currency module can be broken down
into four main components and the supporting enhancements.<br>
The new components are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Currency: the concept of currency as a mnemonic, description,
symbol, exchange conventions, rounding conventions, etc.</li>
<li>Money: an "amount of some currency" providing math operations,
the input and return parameters for foreign exchange, etc.</li>
<li>Exchange Rates: classes for holding dynamic and static exchange
rates and managing exchange rate tables.</li>
<li>The money formatters.</li>
</ul>
The enhancements are:
<ul>
<li>the Date-Time classes</li>
<li>amount of time class</li>
<li>the rounding classes</li>
</ul>
<p>For a more detailed business level explanation of the module,
see the related OMG document (<a href=
"ftp://ftp.omg.org/pub/docs/formal/00-06-29.pdf">ftp://ftp.omg.org/pub/docs/formal/00-06-29.pdf</a>).</p>
<h3>Quantlib::Currency Namespace Note</h3>
<p>All related currency, money, and exchange rate classes in a new
namespace named "Currency". The supporting enhancements are all
contained the "QuantLib" namespace.</p>
<h3>Currency Component Description</h3>
<p>Currency encapsulates basic descriptive information of a
currency, the methods used to create a currency and. This
includes:<br></p>
<ol>
<li>currency name. e.g. "U.S. Dollar"</li>
<li>mnemonic e.g. "USD"</li>
<li>numeric code e.g. "840" (used for ISO currencies)</li>
<li>symbol e.g. "$"</li>
<li>fraction symbol e.g. "&cent;"</li>
<li>scale factor e.g. 10</li>
<li>ratio of fraction to whole e.g. 100 for dollar:cents</li>
<li>description e.g. "United States Dollar"</li>
<li>introduction date e.g. (QuantLib default date)</li>
<li>expiration date e.g. (QuantLib default date)</li>
<li>if it represents and ISO currency description</li>
<li>if ISO, which version it represents</li>
<li>if the external/internal output should display fractional
part</li>
<li>operations to allow setting external/internal output
display</li>
<li>a set of locales for which the currency is used (for ISO
currencies)</li>
<li>operations to add/remove locales</li>
<li>operations to return exchange triangulation next/last
currencies</li>
<li>operations to return preferred rounding method</li>
<li>an equality operator for comparing two currencies</li>
</ol>
<h4>Currency Module Design and Static Model</h4>
<img src="quep_6_files/quep_6_static_diagram.png" alt=
"Currency static diagram" width="912" height="486">
<p>The Currency class hierarchy is using the pimpl idiom for
lightweight copying and to make polymorphic currency behavior
available to scripting languages without the Handle template
problems. The base class Currency contains a Handle to the
CurrencyImpl abstract class which is comprised of the data fields
and getter definitions for Currency. (For more information about
the pimpl idiom, see <a href=
"http://www.quantlib.org/quep/quep001.html">1: Implementing
polymorphic behavior by means of the pimpl idiom.</a></p>
<p>Usually when applying the pimpl idiom, all operations called on
Currency would then be proxied to peer operations on the
CurrencyImpl class through the Handle reference. For the Currency
class this is only true for the <b>addLocale</b> and
<b>removeLocale</b> operations. The rest directly access the public
member variables of the CurrencyImpl. it would create more work to
duplicate all the <b>getXXX</b> operations in the Currency and
CurrencyImpl classes without providing any clear benefits.</p>
<p>The only responsibility of the CurrencyImpl subclasses are to
define implementation for the <b>addLocale/removeLocale</b> and
<b>setExtern/InternOutputShowingFractions</b> operations and data
initialization on construction.</p>
<p>The DefaultCurrency class is used by the client to create
currencies that do not already exist as classes in the library. Two
constructors are provided: a default constructor that creates a
Currency with only the default data values and a constructor that
takes in the parameters to create a Currency object with user
specified values.</p>
<p>There are also several Currency subclasses that implement the
most common ISO currencies. They are all designed as singletons so
their constructors are declared protected. Instances should be
created/retrieved by calling the <b>getInstance</b> operation on
each. The ISOCurrencyImpl adapter class defines the
<b>addLocale/removeLocale</b> so that the ISOCurrencyImpl
subclasses need only handle data initialization for the relevant
ISO currency definition. Planned ISO currency classes are
USDCurrency, JPYCurrency, EURCurrency, and GBPCurrency. This list
will grow as needed.</p>
<h4>Currency Implementation Notes</h4>
<p>The following are descriptions of the data fields on the
CurrencyImpl class. Collectively they hold the state information
for every currency object.</p>
<blockquote><b>string name</b><br>
<b>string mnemonic</b><br>
<b>string numeric</b><br>
<b>string symbol</b><br>
<b>string fractionSymbol</b><br>
<b>string description</b><br>
They are meant to contain ISO 4217:1995 data, but that is left up
to the client constructing the Currency instance.<br>
<br>
<b>long Currency::scaleFactor</b><br>
This is the number of significant digits preferred to represent an
amount of this currency. For now, setting the <b>scaleFactor</b>
will have no effect. It is intended to be used by Money via the
Decimal object reference (Money.value). For the time being, Decimal
is just a typedef to a double, therefore <b>scaleFactor</b> has no
relevance yet.<br>
<br>
<b>int ratioFract2Whole</b><br>
The ratio of the fraction part to whole part of a currency is the
ratio between the smallest unit of the fractional part of a
currency and one unit of the whole part of a currency. The ratio
for United States Dollars is one hundred pennies to one dollar, so
<b>ratioFract2Whole = 100</b>. In cases where there is no minor
part of a currency (i.e., Yen), it will be set to 1.<br>
<br>
<b>DateTime introductionDate</b><br>
<b>DateTime expirationDate</b><br>
Introduction/Expiration date will contain a default date if none
exists. The default date used is defined by the QuantLib::DateTime
class implementation if none is provided by the client
instantiating the currency.<br>
<br>
<b>boolean isISO</b><br>
<b>string isoVersion</b><br>
For more on the ISO currency names and codes see the ISO 4217:1995
currency specification.<br>
<br>
<b>vector&lt;string&gt; locale</b><br>
A user can add and remove locales from any currency. A
CurrencyException of type "UNKNOWN_LOCALE" will be thrown if the
locale passed in is not found on the list of ISO defined locales
(ISO 4217:1995).<br>
<br>
<b>Rounding prefRounding</b><br>
Some currencies have preferred rounding requirements. The Money
class uses this to determine how to round for arithmetic operations
if no other Rounding class is specified.<br>
<br>
<b>Currency nextCurrency/lastCurrency</b><br>
These operations will be used by the ExchangeRateManager in order
to follow triangulated exchange requirements of some currencies.
All of the Euro member currencies will return the instance of
EURCurrency. There is more on this in the ExchangeRateManager
notes.</blockquote>
<!-- END QUANTLIB::CURRENCY::CURRENCY CLASSES -->
<!-- BEGIN MONEY -->
<h3>Money</h3>
<p>Money can be thought of as a currency instance. It holds a
decimal value (some amount of money) and provides for arithmetic
and comparison operations on that amount of money.</p>
<p>Note that the Money class makes use of a new type: Decimal. For
now, that is just a typedef to a double. Going forward it should a
typedef to a class which contains arbitrary precision decimal
representation standard across all platforms and not subject to the
rounding problems with floats. For convenience, this should
probably expose math operations like rounding (through compositor
Rounding class), abs, etc. But this should be the subject of
another QuEP.</p>
<h4>Money Static Model</h4>
<img src="quep_6_files/quep_6_static_diagram_Money.png" alt=
"Money static diagram">
<p>Money is a concrete class providing all the operations necessary
to create a new instance, compare two Money objects, and to do
basic math. The client can instantiate a Money object with a
different rounding to that which the Currency prefers and/or to
provide a reference to an ExchangeRateManager object (for currency
conversion).</p>
<p>At the minimum, the client must pass a Currency and a Decimal to
create a Money instance. Money will attempt to use the rounding
associated with its Currency if no other Rounding object is
specified. If the Currency has no specific rounding associated to
it, no rounding will be performed until the client provides a
Rounding object with the setRounding operation.</p>
<p>The CurrencyParams class contains two static variables used by
Money when attempting math on two Money objects of different
Currencies. The ConversionType contains the values that indicate
whether this type of operation is legal and if so what kind of
conversion to use. The Base_Currency refers to the Currency to use
for conversion if ConversionType = "BASE_CURRENCY_CONVERSION".</p>
<h4>Money Implementation Notes</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Math Operations</b><br>
When automatic conversion is allowed and two Money's with different
Currencies are added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided, the
result will be a Money instance with the Currency on the right side
of the operator.<br>
<br>
Money[sourceCcy] + Money[targetCcy] = Money[targetCcy]<br>
<br>
If base currency conversion is allowed, then the result is in terms
of the <b>CurrencyParams.BaseCurrency</b><br>
<br>
Money[oneCcy] + Money[anotherCcy] = Money[baseCcy]<br>
<br>
This only applies to the operators. If the operation <b>add(Money
m)</b> is passed a Money with a different Currency, the result will
be reflected in the <b>Money.value</b> on that object. The Currency
will be the same as before <b>add</b> was called.<br>
<br>
<b>Please note,</b> whenever Currency exchange is required to do
math or logical tests, the values are converted first, then the
math is performed on the converted values. Rounding is applied to
each individually converted amount by calling Money.round() on
each. For example, using the examples above, the illustration below
outlines the steps taken for conversion and rounding:<br>
Automatic Conversion Case<br>
Money1[sourceCcy] + Money2[targetCcy] = Money3[targetCcy]<br></p>
<ol>
<li>convert Money1[sourceCcy] -&gt; Money1[targetCcy]</li>
<li>Money1[targetCcy].round() - using the same Rounding object as
Money2[targetCcy]</li>
<li>add Money1 + Money2</li>
</ol>
Base Currency Conversion Case<br>
Money1[oneCcy] + Money2[anotherCcy] = Money[BaseCurrency]<br>
<ol>
<li>convert Money1[oneCcy] -&gt; Money1[baseCcy]</li>
<li>Money1[baseCcy].round() - using the default Rounding object for
BaseCurrency</li>
<li>Money2[baseCcy].round() - using the default Rounding object for
BaseCurrency</li>
<li>add Money1 + Money2</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether or not an attempt to add/subtract two Moneys with
different Currencies will succeed is determined by the
following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Money must contain a reference to an ExchangeRateManager object
that is able to furnish all the exchange rates necessary to perform
a conversion.</li>
<li>The CurrencyParams.ConversionType must be
"BASE_CURRENCY_CONVERSION" or "AUTOMATED_CONVERSION"</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Comparison Operators</b><br>
In addition to the math operators, the following logical operators
are overloaded as well:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;</li>
<li>&gt;</li>
<li>==</li>
<li>&lt;=</li>
<li>&gt;=</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Money::round()/rounding()</b><br>
If the Currency specifies a rounding preference (for example
EURCurrency), rounding will be turned on (<b>isRounding</b> will
return true). This indicates that all arithmetic operations will be
finish by rounding/truncating the final value. The resulting
precision is of course determined by the Rounding implementation
used. If the Currency does not specify a rounding type, rounding
will remain off, calling <b>rounding()</b> will return 0, and
calling <b>round()</b> will have no effect on <b>value</b>.</p>
<!-- END MONEY -->
<!-- BEGIN Exchange Rates -->
<h3>Exchange Rate and Exchange Rate Managers</h3>
<p>The exchange rate abstraction contains references to source
currency, target currency, the conversion factor, and a rate type
identifier. It provides operations for exchanging Money between the
source and target currencies. Using a MarketElement member to
represent the conversion factor makes the exchange rate observable
thought a common interface. A specialized type of Exchange Rate
provides date bounded exchange rates.</p>
<p>The Exchange Rate manager abstraction contains a collection of
exchange rates and operations for adding, removing, and querying.
The look ups are base on source currency, target currency, and rate
type. If set to do so, the lookup can create and return derived
rates when no explicit direct rate exists. It also takes into
account triangulated exchange requirements if present in the source
and/or target currencies (Euroland currencies, for example). The
related abstraction, DExchangeRateManager, performs serves the same
purpose, but for date bounded exchange rates.</p>
<h4>Exchange Rate and Exchange Rate Managers Static Model</h4>
<img src="quep_6_files/quep_6_static_diagram_Exchange.png" alt=
"Exchange Rates static diagram">
<p>ExchangeRate is a concrete class that may be constructed with a
Currency source, a Currency target, a MarketElement conversion
factor, and optionally a string Type. If no string type is
provided, it will be defaulted to "direct". The conversion factor
is a reference to a QuantLib::MarketElement providing the benefits
of the observer/observable pattern and for cohesiveness with the
rest of the library. The ExchangeRateList rateChain is a Vector for
use when a "direct" exchange is not possible. There are no public
setters. All changes to the conversion factor should be performed
through the MarketElement. The main function, <b>exchange</b>,
takes in Money of either source or target Currency and returns a
new Money object reference of the target or source Currency.</p>
<p>DExchangeRate extends ExchangeRate to add
<b>startDate/endDate</b> operations. It also provides constructors
for including DateTime startDate/endDate.</p>
<p>RateManager is a template providing functions for storage and
lookup of ExchangeRates. A subclass RateManager adds the
<b>lookup</b> operation that also takes in a DateTime as a search
parameter. The type ExchangeRateManager and DExchangeRateManager
are a typedef's to RateManager&lt;ExchangeRate&gt; and to
DRateManager&lt;DExchangeRate&gt;, respectively.</p>
<p>The ExchangeRates are held in a RateMap for efficient lookup.
For Now, RateMap is a typedef to a Map, but if the need arises
could be a typedef to an appropriate HashMap.</p>
<p>ExchangeRateManager and DExchangeRateManager are concrete class
that maintain and perform lookups on ExchangeRateList and
DExchangeRateList members, respectively. They were designed as
separate classes because the operations should be named the same
and in some cases take in the same parameters (the
<b>lookupRate</b> function), but return different types. This is
not valid polymorphic behavior so can not be expressed in a class
hierarchy. The functionality they do share (although not publicly)
is inherited from the superclass ExchangeRateManager base.</p>
<h4>Exchange Rate and Exchange Rate Manager Implementation
Notes</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><b>typedef Vector&lt;ExchangeRate&gt; ExchangeRateList</b><br>
<b>typedef Vector&lt;DExchangeRate&gt; DExchangeRateList</b></p>
<b>typedef RateManager&lt;DExchangeRate&gt; RateMap</b> <b>typedef
RateManager&lt;DExchangeRate&gt; DRateMap</b>
<p><b>ExchangeRateManager::lookupRate()</b> At a minimum, this
function needs a target and a source currency. The
ExchangeRateManager will attempt to find an ExchangeRate with the
same source/target currencies first, followed by an ExchangeRate
with the source/target currencies in the inverse order. If no type
is specified, the type of "any" will be assumed. The following type
prioritization is used:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>"direct" type</li>
<li>"derived" type</li>
</ul>
If a specific type is passed in, only an exchange rate of that type
will be returned. Because ExchangeRate.type is defined as a string
it could be client defined however they choose. However the
ExchangeRateManager recognize the following types as special:<br>
<ul>
<li>"any": if "any" is passed in, the lookup acts as outlined
above. This is the same as calling <b>lookupRate</b> without
passing the type parameter</li>
<li>"direct": the default type for client defined ExchangeRates. If
passed in, then no derived types may be returned.</li>
<li>"derived": when ExchangeRateManager creates an ExchangeRate by
triangulation it returns a "derived" type rate. These may be added
to the ExchangeRate manager for efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>lookupRate</b> handles the cases where specific rules have
been given for exchanging through an intermediary currency. For
example, all currency exchanges between Euro currencies and any
other currency must first be exchanged through the Euro. This is
also true to Euro currency to Euro currency exchanges. ( <a href=
"http://europa.eu.it">europa.eu.it</a> )<br>
ExchangeRateManager uses the
<b>Currency.nextCurrency/lastCurrency</b> information to construct
a "derived" type ExchangeRate that follows the exchange
triangulation conventions.</p>
<p>
<b>ExchangeRateManager::isAutoAddDerived/setAutoAddDerived</b><br>
Options are available to automatically add derived exchange rates
to the internal map so that subsequent lookups are more
efficient.</p>
<p><b>ExchangeRate::Exchange()</b><br>
The conversion implementation allows for bi-directional exchange
based on the Money.currency passed in. For example, if the
ExhangeRate was constructed with USD as the source currency and EUR
as the target currency (ExchangeRate[USD2EUR]), then passing in a
Money[EUR] would cause the Money[EUR].value() to be divided by the
conversionFactor's value. A new instance of Money[USD] with the
result would be returned. Conversely, passing in a Money[USD] would
cause Money[USD].value() to be multiplied by the conversionFactor's
value. A new instance of Money[EUR] with the result would be
returned.<br>
Note that <b>exchange</b> does not round before returning the Money
instance. If the client wants a rounded value, call the
<b>Money.round</b> operation. If conversion is happening due to
arithmetic on differently denominated Money's, the any rounding is
left up to the Money object. It does not happen here.<br>
In the case that the exchange rate is type "derived", this means
that the rateChain contains an vector of ExchangeRate objects. In
this case, rather than use the conversionFactor, <b>exchange</b>
iterates through the list from top to bottom calling
<b>exchange</b> on each. For example, if the ExchangeRate is
"derived" for converting FRF into JPY, and the rateChain contains
the following:<br></p>
<ol>
<li>ExchangeRate[FRF to EUR]</li>
<li>ExchangeRate[JPY to EUR]</li>
</ol>
Calling exchange(Money[FRF]) would do the following::<br>
<ol>
<li>Money[EUR] = ExchangeRate[FRF2EUR].exchange( Money[FRF] )</li>
<li>Money[JPY] = ExchangeRate[EUR2JPY].exchange( Money[EUR] )</li>
<li>return Money[JPY]</li>
</ol>
<p><b>ExchangeRate::type()</b><br>
Types used by the ExchangeRateManager's are "Direct" and "Derived"
although clients creating new ExchangeRate instances can input any
string. When adding ExchangeRates to an ExchangeRateManager, the
only condition is that the combination of type, source, and target
currencies must be unique. "Direct" is the default for client
instantiated instances because the conversion factor represents an
explicit mapping from the source to target currency. "Derived" is
used by the ExchangeRateManager to indicate that it constructed the
ExchangeRate from a chain of "Direct" and/or "Derived" rates.</p>
<p>Note that the == (equals) operator is also overloaded.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- END EXCHANGE RATES --><!-- BEGIN ROUNDING/TRUNCATION -->
<h3>Rounding/Truncation</h3>
<p>A simple set of classes have is created for the purposes of
rounding money after it has been exchanged and after money
arithmetic. It is outside of the Currency namespace so can be used
wherever rounding/truncation is needed.</p>
<h4>Rounding/Truncation Static Model</h4>
<img src="quep_6_files/quep_6_static_diagram_rounding.png" alt=
"Rounding static diagram">
<p>Rounding is the abstract base class defining the basic operation
for rounding. The subclasses provide the implementation for their
specific types of rounding (strategy pattern).</p>
<h4>Rounding/Truncation Implementation Notes</h4>
<p>The Ceiling/FloorTruncation classes are concrete subclasses
implementing the two basic types of truncation at with arbitrary
precision. The precision is specified by the client by passing an
int representing the decimal precision of the truncated number.</p>
<p>ComputersRuleRounding rounds just as VB/Excel does for
currencies: when the 1st digit dropped is 5 with no following
digits or 5 with following digits, then add 1 to the rounding place
if current digit is odd, leave it as is if even. As with the
truncation classes, the client only specifies the internal
precision.</p>
<p>EuroRounding rounds as specified in "Euro Paper 22" ( find it at
<a href="http://europa.eu.it">europa.eu.it</a> ): Round to 2
digits. If the 3rd significant digit is less than 5, then round
down, else round up. Because the precision is already set by the
specification, only the default constructor is available.</p>
<p>CustomRounding is implemented to follow the OMG guidelines for
rounding (at least in the Currency specification). The client
passes in both the precision and the rounding digit upon
construction. The round implementation checks the first digit after
the specified precision to see if it is equal to or greater than
the rounding digit. If so, it rounds the preceding digit up, else
it leaves it unchanged. For example, if precision=2 and rounding
digit=4, then the number 458.564 would round up to 458.57. The
number 458.563 would round to 458.56.<br>
Note that this could be also used to construct a
"LooseEuroRounding" object by using 5 as the rounding digit and
selecting a precision greater than 2.</p>
<!--END ROUNDING/TRUNCATION -->
<!-- BEGIN DATE-TIME AND AMOUNTOFTIME -->
<h3>Date-Time and Amount of Time</h3>
<p>DateTime extends the concept of Date in QuantLib to include a
time component as well as enhancing the interface to be more OMG
DTime like. It has been designed to be backwards compatible with
the current QuantLib usage of Date. This does not guarantee
compatibility with all <b>client</b> usage of QuantLib::Date,
however.</p>
<p>AmountOfTime is used with the DateTime class for flexible
date-time addition and to represent a difference between two
DateTime's.</p>
<h4>DateTime Static Model</h4>
<img src="quep_6_files/quep_6_static_diagram_DateTime.png" alt=
"DateTime static diagram">
<p>DateTime is an abstract class that declares the operations for
basic date time functionality. It is more or less a union between
the operations on QuantLib::Date and the OMG DTime value interface
definition. It also contains static members defining the minimum,
maximum, and default date-time's.</p>
<p>The first concrete implementation of DateTime is ExcelDateTime.
Because the Excel serial number can hold precision down to the
second (in the fractional part), the ExcelDateTime class leverages
the existing Quantlib::Date class to represent DateTime. In the
near future, other more efficient concrete DateTime classes will be
created. This will be the subject of a QuEP yet to come.</p>
<p>You will note that the pimpl idiom was not used for the DateTime
class hierarchy. For the pimpl idiom to be most beneficial, the
concrete implementing classes should not define new operations
outside of object construction. They should each contain a specific
implementation for the operations defined in the abstract
implementing superclass. In the case of DateTime, we already know
that at least one subclass will be adding operations that are
unique to that subclass. For example, ExcelDateTime has getters and
setters for the Excel style serial number it contains. Probably no
other DateTime concrete class will need these operations. As other
DateTime implementations are created other similarly unique
operations will be added (e.g. formatDate/formatTime). Because
these new operations can not be defined in terms of those existing
in the superclass, it is not appropriate to use the pimpl idiom
here.</p>
<p>The QuantLib::Date class is still intended to be used via its
static operations. There is no corresponding <b>isLeapYear</b>
operation on the new DateTime interface.</p>
<p>AmountOfTime (not in the model) is not an extension of the
Quantlib::Period class. Instead it is a new class implemented more
or less exactly along the lines of the OMG spec DAmountOfTime
interface. If needed, the Period class could be enhanced to return
an AmountOfTime representation of itself, but that is not the focus
of this enhancement.</p>
<h4>DateTime Implementation Notes</h4>
<blockquote>In addition to the operations shown in the static
model, there are overloaded operators to provide DateTime
comparisons (&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, ==), to subtract one date
from another, and to add or subtract an AmountOfTime from a
DateTime. Here are examples of the arithmetic operators:<br>
<br>
<b>DateTime + AmountOfTime = DateTime</b><br>
<br>
<b>DateTime - AmountOfTime = DateTime</b><br>
<br>
<b>DateTime - DateTime = AmountOfTime</b><br>
<br>
Hours, Minutes, Seconds types shown in the model are typedef'd to
int's. This is inline with QuantLib's current Day
type.</blockquote>
