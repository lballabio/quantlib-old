<h1>QuEP 10: Separation of concerns in RelinkableHandle</h1>
<div class="center">Luigi Ballabio</div>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The <tt>RelinkableHandle</tt> class reimplements a number of
functionalities which are already present in the <tt>Handle</tt>
and <tt>Observable</tt> classes.</p>
<p>A reimplementation of the former is presented which takes
advantage of code reuse while achieving separation of concerns.</p>
<h2>Current implementation</h2>
<p>The purpose of the <tt>RelinkableHandle</tt> class is to provide
a shared point of access to a <tt>Handle</tt>. Should the latter be
replaced, all the clients of the <tt>RelinkableHandle</tt> would be
aware of the change and would start accessing the new
<tt>Handle</tt>. Its current implementation can be sketched as
follows:</p>
<pre>
template &lt;class Type&gt;
class RelinkableHandle {
  public:
    // constructor, copy constructor, assignment operator, destructor
    ...
    // relinking functionality
    void linkTo(const Handle&lt;Type&gt;&amp; h);
    // handle functionality
    Type* operator-&gt;() const;
    bool isNull() const;
    // observable functionality - note that it does not inherit from Observable
    void registerObserver(Observer*);
    void unregisterObserver(Observer*);
  private:
    Handle&lt;Type&gt;** ptr_;
    int* n_;
    class InnerObserver : public Observable,
                          public Observer {
      public:
        // Observer interface
        void update() { notifyObservers(); }
    };
    InnerObserver* observer_;
};

</pre>
<p>A number of issues are present in this design, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>The point of access to the <tt>Handle</tt> should be shared
among the copies of <tt>RelinkableHandle</tt>; hence the
<tt>Handle**</tt> data member;</li>
<li>Reference counting is implemented in order to keep the
<tt>Handle</tt> alive as long as the last <tt>RelinkableHandle</tt>
copy is; hence the <tt>int*</tt> data member;</li>
<li>Observability must be shared as well, i.e., an
<tt>Observer</tt> which registered with a <tt>RelinkableHandle</tt>
should be notified of relinking occurring in any copy of the
latter; this is the reason why the <tt>RelinkableHandle</tt> class
does not inherit from <tt>Observable</tt>---which would only
provide per-instance observability. Instead,
<tt>RelinkableHandle</tt> shares a copy of an inner
<tt>Observable</tt> class; hence the <tt>InnerObserver*</tt> data
member.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, all these issues force <tt>RelinkableHandle</tt> to
implement the appropriate copy semantics and to perform the
appropriate clean-up upon destruction.</p>
<h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The reference-counted sharing implementation is already
implemented in <tt>Handle</tt> itself and is unnecessarily
duplicated here. Should the <tt>Handle</tt> implementation change,
<tt>RelinkableHandle</tt> should be modified accordingly. Moreover,
should <tt>Handle</tt> be replaced in the future by another shared
pointer implementation such as <tt>boost::shared_ptr</tt> or any
other class in a future C++ standard, its implementation could not
be easily replicated into <tt>RelinkableHandle</tt>. As a matter of
fact, it should not.</li>
<li>The implementation of <a href="quep008.html">QuEP 8</a> would
clash with the fact that <tt>RelinkableHandle</tt> is not an
<tt>Observable</tt> and as such cannot be stored by the registered
<tt>Observer</tt>s. At most, its inner observer class could be
wrapped in a <tt>Handle</tt> and passed to the <tt>Observer</tt>;
however, we should either make <tt>Observer</tt> aware of the
existence of <tt>RelinkableHandle</tt> and provide it with an
overloaded <tt>registerWith</tt> method---which would introduce
unnecessary coupling between the two classes---or provide
<tt>RelinkableHandle</tt> with an automatic conversion to its inner
observer handle---which does not make a lot of sense. Moreover,
there would exist the possibility that a stored <tt>Handle</tt> to
the inner observer could outlive its <tt>RelinkableHandle</tt>. The
possibility was too scary for me to analyze its consequences.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Proposed implementation</h2>
<p>The <tt>Handle</tt> implementation of reference-counted
shared-body semantics can be reused by adding another layer of
indirection between <tt>RelinkableHandle</tt> and its underlying
shared instance. Namely, a class would be introduced which
encapsulates the concept of shared and relinkable access to a
<tt>Handle</tt> as follows:</p>
<pre>
template &lt;class T&gt;
class Link : public Observable, public Observer {
  public:
    Link(const Handle&lt;T&gt;&amp; h = Handle&lt;T&gt;())
    : link_(h) {
        if (!link_.isNull())
            registerWith(link_);
    }
    // the default copy semantics and destructor are fine
    // as soon as Observer's copy semantics is fixed as in QuEP 8
    void linkTo(const Handle&lt;T&gt;&amp; h) {
        unregisterWith(link_);
        link_ = h;
        if (!link_.isNull())
            registerWith(link_);
        notifyObservers();
    }
    const Handle&lt;T&gt;&amp; currentLink() const { return link_; }
    void update() { notifyObservers(); }
  private:
    Handle&lt;T&gt; link_;
};

</pre>
<p>This would allow <tt>RelinkableHandle</tt> to be defined as:</p>
<pre>
template &lt;class T&gt;
class RelinkableHandle : public Handle&lt;Link&lt;T&gt; &gt; { ... };

</pre>
<p>Inheriting from <tt>Handle&lt;Link&gt;</tt> already solves our
problems. Namely, <tt>RelinkableHandle</tt> now inherits the
correct copy semantics and clean-up. Also, it can be automatically
and meaningfully converted to a <tt>Handle&lt;Observer&gt;</tt> and
transparently stored into <tt>Observer</tt> without modifying the
latter. Finally, it can be made to work with another shared pointer
implementation simply by replacing <tt>Handle</tt> with the latter
in <tt>Link</tt> and in the inheritance declaration.</p>
<p>The reason why we actually inherit from
<tt>Handle&lt;Link&gt;</tt> instead of using a simple
<tt>typedef</tt> is that inheritance allows us to made the new
<tt>RelinkableHandle</tt> backward-compatible and define a few
syntactic shortcuts. The new class simply acts as an adapter to its
base class and can be sketched as follows:</p>
<pre>
template &lt;class T&gt;
class RelinkableHandle : public Handle&lt;Link&lt;T&gt; &gt; {
  public:
    RelinkableHandle(const Handle&lt;T&gt;&amp; h = Handle&lt;T&gt;())
    : Handle&lt;Link&lt;T&gt; &gt;(new Link(h)) {}
    // relinking functionality forwarded to Link
    void linkTo(const Handle&lt;Type&gt;&amp; h) { (**this).linkTo(h); }
    // operator-&gt; is forwarded to the Handle&lt;T&gt; rather than to Link
    Handle&lt;T&gt;&amp; operator-&gt;() const { return (**this).currentLink(); }
    // isNull checks the Handle&lt;T&gt; rather than itself
    bool isNull() const { return (**this).currentLink().isNull(); }
};

</pre>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>An implementation of <tt>RelinkableHandle</tt> was proposed
which leverages functionalities already implemented in the QuantLib
library. The resulting design is simpler and more easily adaptable
to future changes.</p>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>Feedback on the above proposal should be posted to the <a href=
