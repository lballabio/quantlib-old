<h1>QuEP 1: Polymorphic behavior by means of the <em>pimpl</em>
idiom</h1>
<div class="center">Luigi Ballabio</div>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Composition of polymorphic types requires instances of the
latter to be stored as either pointers or references since a copy
operation would upcast them to their base class. However, neither
pointer nor reference data members are guaranteed to point to a
valid object for the entire lifetime of the enclosing object.</p>
<p>The solution currently implemented in QuantLib uses Handle
objects which wrap a pointer ensuring that it is not deallocated as
long as it is referred to by some client object. This results in
adding a layer of complexity to relatively simple and ubiquitously
used objects such as Calendar and DayCounter since instances of the
latter must be stored, passed and returned as
Handle&lt;Calendar&gt; and Handle&lt;DayCounter&gt;,
respectively.</p>
<p>An alternative proposal is detailed here which would allow the
direct use of Calendar and DayCounter instances as opposed to
Handles to the same, while at the same time retaining the
polymorphic behavior expected from such classes.</p>
<h2>Current implementation</h2>
<p>The current implementation of the Calendar class and of a client
class with a Calendar data member is shown in the diagram
below.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="quep001/quep001a.png" width="606" height=
"228" alt="UML diagram"></div>
<p>Calendar is an abstract class with a purely virtual method
isBusinessDay(). Other methods such as isHoliday() and advance()
are concrete and implemented in terms of isBusinessDay(). Concrete
calendars derive from Calendar and implement the Calendar
interface, namely, isBusinessDay(). Client classes contain Handles
to Calendar.</p>
<h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
<p>Handles to Calendar must be passed, stored and returned. The
Calendar class, its children, and the client class are coded
as:</p>
<pre>
class Calendar {
  public:
    virtual bool isBusinessDay(const Date&amp;) const = 0;
};

class ConcreteCalendar : public Calendar {
  public:
    bool isBusinessDay(const Date&amp;) const;
};

class ClientClass {
  public:
    // accept a calendar upon construction
    ClientClass(const Handle&lt;Calendar&gt;&amp; calendar);
    // returns its calendar
    Handle&lt;Calendar&gt; calendar() const;
  private:
    Handle&lt;Calendar&gt; calendar_;
};
</pre>
<p>which adds complexity to the declaration.</p>
<p>Handles must also be exported towards scripting languages for
which a QuantLib module exists. This adds complexity to the SWIG
interfaces, namely, Handle&lt;Calendar&gt; must be exported and
masqueraded as a Calendar class in order to hide the smart pointer
concept which has no meaning in the scripting languages. This also
implies that the Calendar interface must be added to the
corresponding Python class, derived classes must be exported as
Handles as well, and inheritance must be faked between Handles
pointing to derived Calendars.</p>
<h2>Proposed implementation</h2>
<p>The proposed implementation is a variation of the <em>pimpl</em>
(Pointer IMPLementation) idiom, in which the implementation of a
class is contained in a separate object contained by the class
instances.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="quep001/quep001b.png" width="606" height=
"287" alt="UML diagram"></div>
<p>Calendar is now a concrete class which no virtual methods.
Polymorphism is implemented by storing into a Calendar instance a
Handle to a CalendarImpl object which implements the polymorphic
isBusinessDay() method and to which the Calendar instance delegates
the task of determining whether a given day is a business day or a
holiday.</p>
<p>Derived Calendar classes can be defined which initialize the
Handle with the desired concrete CalendarImpl. The only task of
such derived Calendars is to customize the initialization process,
without adding any new functionality to the Calendar interface. As
such, they can be upcasted to Calendar without any loss of
information occurring.</p>
<p>A Calendar instance can now be safely copied, since the
Handle&lt;CalendarImpl&gt; will be copied as well, thus preserving
the polymorphic behavior of the Calendar.</p>
<p>The Calendar class, its children, and the client class are coded
as:</p>
<pre>
class Calendar {
  protected:
    // protected constructor inhibits instantiating Calendar itself
    Calendar() {}
    class CalendarImpl {
      public:
        virtual bool isBusinessDay(const Date&amp; d) const = 0;
    };
    Handle&lt;CalendarImpl&gt; impl_;
  public:
    bool isBusinessDay(const Date&amp; d) const {
        return impl_-&gt;isBusinessDay(d);
    }
};

class ConcreteCalendar : public Calendar {
  protected:
    class ConcreteCalendarImpl : public CalendarImpl {
      public:
        bool isBusinessDay(const Date&amp; d) const;
    };
  public:
    ConcreteCalendar() {
        impl_ = Handle&lt;CalendarImpl&gt;(new ConcreteCalendarImpl);
    }
};

class ClientClass {
  public:
    // accept a calendar upon construction
    ClientClass(const Calendar&amp; calendar);
    // returns its calendar
    Calendar calendar() const;
  private:
    Calendar calendar_;
};
</pre>
<p>The effect of this new implementation is that we moved
complexity between layers, i.e., client classes can be defined and
used in an easier way at the expense of a bit more coding for the
developers of Calendar classes. We believe this to be an
advantageous trade-off, since the classes which use Calendars are
many more that the Calendar classes themselves.</p>
<p>Also, the Calendar class and its children can now be directly
exported to scripting languages by means of SWIG, without resorting
to the current handle masquerading.</p>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
