<h1 class="center">QuantLib Installation in VC++ 2010</h1>
<h4 class="center">Dominik Holenstein</h4>

<h6 class="center">Based on the VC++ 2008 instructions by Dimitri Reiswich</h4>

<p>These are step-by-step instructions to install QuantLib and Boost on the
Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 IDE (you can download the free Express edition 
at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/">http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/</a>.)
I tried to include almost every step in the installation
procedure. Something that is obvious to one person might not be
obvious to someone else. The only thing that I assume you have on
your computer is the Visual C++ 2010 IDE (VC10).</p>

<p>These instructions are for MS Visual C++ 2010 only. If you have
earlier versions of this IDE (2008, 2005...) then have a look
at <a href="vc9.shtml">this page</a>.</p>

<p>Before using QuantLib you need to install the Boost library on your
computer. Detailed instructions follow in the next section.</p>

<h2>Boost Installation</h2>
<p>We use the installer provided by BoostPro
Computing, that can be downloaded
at <a href="http://www.boostpro.com/download">http://www.boostpro.com/download</a>.</p>

<p>At the time of this writing, the current version is the
executable <tt>boost_1_47_setup.exe</tt> and can be downloaded for
free in just a few seconds. Double clicking the installer yields the
screen shown below. Select the download mirror of your choice or
"Nearest SourceForge Mirror" (recommended).</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc10/boost01.png" alt="Mirror selection"></p>

<p>The next step asks you to select the binaries to download. Since we
are using Visual Studio 2010, we will select this version in the left
panel. In the right panel, select Multithreaded, Multithreaded Debug,
Multithreaded static runtime, and Multithreaded Debug static
runtime. The others are not needed by QuantLib, but you might want to
download them anyway. The resulting screen is shown below.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc10/boost02.png" alt="Version selection"></p>

<p>The next window asks you which libraries you'd like to install. You
can add any library that you want besides the ones selected by
default; the one needed for a complete QuantLib build is the unit test
framework, which can be found at the end of the list.  Here is the
corresponding screen.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc10/boost03.png" alt="Default library selection"></p>

<p>Choose the VC10.0 to include the unit test framework. You can also
open the VC10.0 list and select specific build versions.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc10/boost04.png" alt="Library selection"></p>

<p>The next step asks for a destination folder. I will install
everything in the folder <tt>C:\Program
Files\boost\boost_1_47</tt>. Feel free to choose your own folder.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc10/boost05.png" alt="Install location"></p>

<p>Clicking Install starts the download, which takes a while. After
finishing, the final screen should say:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc10/boost06.png" alt="Boost installed"></p>

<h2>Boost and QuantLib Installation</h2>

<p>If you go to the <i>Tools/Options</i> page in VC10 to set the necessary VC++ directories, you get this confusing screen:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc10/ql01.png" alt="VC options"></p>

<p>VC++ Directories are no longer supported in VC10 through
the <i>Tools/Options</i> page. Instead, VC10 introduces the user
settings file <tt>Microsoft.cpp.&lt;Platform&gt;.users.props</tt> to control
global settings including the global search path. These files are
located in
the <tt>$(USERPROFILE)\appdata\local\microsoft\msbuild\v4.0</tt>
directory.</p>

<p>These changes require a different workflow regarding the
installation of QuantLib in connection with Boost compared to VC9 and
older.</p>

<p>Here are the steps to change the settings file accordingly:</p>

<p>1. Open VC10 and make sure you have activated the expert
settings. Go to <i>Tools/Settings</i> and make sure "Expert Settings"
is checked.</p>

<p>2. If you haven't downloaded QuantLib yet, go to its download page
on SourceForge, located
at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/quantlib/files/QuantLib">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/quantlib/files/QuantLib</a></p>

<p>3. Open the QuantLib tree, find the latest version (at the time of
this writing the current version is 1.1, but this might have changed
when you read this) and download the zip archive to your local
drive. This is illustrated in the screenshot below. Unzip the file
wherever you want; in the following, we'll assume that the QuantLib
directory is <tt>C:\Program Files\QuantLib</tt>.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc10/ql02.png" alt="Download
QuantLib"></p>

<p>4. Open the QuantLib folder, then open the Visual Studio solution
called <tt>QuantLib_vc10.sln</tt> by double
clicking. Choose <i>Release</i> from the configuration menu in the
toolbar.</p>

<p>5. Open the Property Manager by clicking on <i>View/Property
Manager</i> and activate it.  Expand the project node of QuantLib in
the Property Manager and then the <i>Configuration/Platform</i> nodes
(see screenshot below). You will see
a <tt>Microsoft.cpp.&lt;Platform&gt;.users</tt> file for
each <i>Configuration/Platform</i> folder. These are the files for the
global settings, similar to the old <i>Tools/Options/VC++
Directories</i> settings.  Select any of them (or multi-select them
all), right-click, and select <i>Properties</i> to bring up the
property page window.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc10/ql03.png" alt="Property
Pages"></p>

<p>6. In the property page window, click on <i>VC++ Directories</i> on
the left pane and add the paths for the Boost directories
in <i>Include Directories</i> and <i>Library Directories</i> in the
right pane. If you installed Boost in <tt>C:\Program
Files\boost\boost_1_47</tt>, you'll have to add <tt>C:\Program
Files\boost\boost_1_47</tt> to the include directories
and <tt>C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_47\lib</tt> to the library
directories.  Click the OK button to set your changes.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc10/ql04.png" alt="Directories
Dialog"></p>

<p>7. Switch back to the <i>Solutions Explorer</i>, right-click on the
solution icon and choose <i>Build Solution</i> to build all
projects. Besides QuantLib, this will build the examples and run the
test suite. The process takes a while (it took 1h and 7 minutes to
build QuantLib and run the tests on a three-years old WinXP notebook
with 3 GB RAM and a 2 GHz Intel dual core processor).</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc10/ql06.png" alt="Build
Solution"></p>

<p>After finishing, the output should show no errors:
<pre>
14>  Test suite "Master Test Suite" passed with:
14>    1703 assertions out of 1703 passed
14>    460 test cases out of 460 passed
14>  
14>   
14>  Tests completed in 29 m 8 s
14>  
========== Build: 15 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========
</pre>
</p>

<p>You are done with building QuantLib. If you want, you can build the
Debug version in the same way by choosing <i>Debug</i> from the
configuration menu as shown below. This will allow you to debug your
application later.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc10/ql07.png" alt="Debug
Configuration"></p>

<h2>Quantlib Usage</h2>

<p>As an example of QuantLib usage, I create
a <tt>QuantLibTest </tt>folder in the <tt>C:\Program
Files\QuantLib</tt> folder and set up a Win32 Console Application in
Visual Studio by clicking <i>File/New Project/Win32 Console
Application</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc10/ql08.png" alt="New Project"></p>

<p>I've chosen the project name <tt>TestingQuantLib</tt>, then I
clicked on OK.  Click on the <i>Next</i> button on the Win32
Application Wizard.  Choose "Console application" as application type
and check "Empty project" in the additional options. Click
on <i>Finish</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc10/ql09.png" alt="Application
Wizard"></p>

<p> Choose, for example, the Release mode for that project.  Note that
very often, users don't setup a project correctly since they build
QuantLib in one mode and try to call it from a test program which runs
in some other mode.  If you built QuantLib in release mode, you should
build your project in release mode. If you build your project in debug
mode without ever building QuantLib in debug mode, you'll have link
errors.</p>

<p>To tell your project where to find QuantLib, open the project
properties by right-clicking on the project icon in the IDE.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc10/ql10.png" alt="Open Project
Properties"></p>

<p>Go to <i>VC++ Directories</i>. You can see that the Boost folders
are already there, so you don't have to do anything to configure
them.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc10/ql11.png" alt="Project
Properties"></p>

<p>Add the QuantLib path (<tt>C:\Program Files\QuantLib</tt> in this
example) to the include directories. The result should be as shown
below.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc10/ql12.png" alt="QuantLib include directory"></p>

<p>Finally, you can add the QuantLib library
path <tt>C:\QuantLib\QuantLib-0.9.7\lib</tt> to the library
directories, or you can go to <i>Configuration
Properties/Linker/General</i> and add it to <i>Additional Library
Directories</i>. Click <i>OK</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc10/ql13.png" alt="QuantLib library dir"></p>

<p>To test if the setup works, add the following program to
the <tt>TestingQuantLib</tt> project. The program tests some Date and
Calendar classes.</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;ql/quantlib.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
        QuantLib::Calendar myCal=QuantLib::UnitedKingdom();
        QuantLib::Date newYearsEve(31,QuantLib::Dec,2008);

        std::cout << "Name: "                       << myCal.name()<< std::endl;
        std::cout << "New Year is Holiday: "        << myCal.isHoliday(newYearsEve)<< std::endl;
        std::cout << "New Year is Business Day: "   << myCal.isBusinessDay(newYearsEve)<< std::endl;

        std::cout << "--------------- Date Counter --------------------" << std::endl;

        QuantLib::Date date1(28,QuantLib::Dec,2008);
        QuantLib::Date date2(04,QuantLib::Jan,2009);

        std::cout << "First Date: "            << date1 << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Second Date: "           << date2 << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Business Days Betweeen: "<< myCal.businessDaysBetween(date1,date2) << std::endl;
        std::cout << "End of Month 1. Date: "  << myCal.endOfMonth(date1) << std::endl;
        std::cout << "End of Month 2. Date: "  << myCal.endOfMonth(date2) << std::endl;

        double tmp;
        std::cin >> tmp;

        return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>Hit F5 to run the program. The output of the program should be:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc10/ql14.png" alt="Program output"></p>

<p>One last thing: If you see some warnings after building, to get rid
of them open the project properties again, go to <i>Configuration
Properties/C/C++/Preprocessor/Preprocessor Definitions</i> and
add <tt>_SCL_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE</tt> and <tt>_CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE</tt>
 to the definitions, as shown here:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc10/ql15.png" alt="Preprocessor defs"></p>

<p>Now, building the TestingQuantLib project again shouldn't show you
any warnings anymore, just as in the Output window below.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc10/ql16.png" alt="Test output"></p>

<p>We're done!</p>
