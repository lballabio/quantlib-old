<h1 class="center">QuantLib Installation in Visual C++</h1>
<h4 class="center">Dimitri Reiswich</h4>

<p>These are step-by-step instructions to install QuantLib on the
Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 IDE (the free Express version can be
downloaded
at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/">http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/</a>.)
I tried to include almost every step in the installation
procedure. Something that is obvious to one person might not be
obvious to someone else. The only thing that I assume that you have on
your computer is the Visual C++ 2008 IDE.</p>

<p>These instructions should also work for Visual C++ 2005 and
(possibly with some slight modification) for Visual C++ 2003.</p>

<p>Before using QuantLib you need to install the Boost library on your
computer. Detailed instructions follow in the next section. There are
two options to install Boost. The first one (the fastest) is to
download an installer, which in turn downloads and extracts pre-built
libraries. The second option is that you build the Boost
libraries. This takes more time than the first option; installation
instructions are provided in the Appendix.</p>

<h2>Boost Installation</h2>
<p>I suggest to use the installer provided by BoostPro
Computing, that can be downloaded
at <a href="http://www.boostpro.com/download">http://www.boostpro.com/download</a>.</p>

<p>At the time of this writing, the current version is the
executable <tt>boost_1_39_setup.exe</tt> and can be downloaded after a
free registration, which takes just a few seconds. Double clicking the
installer yields the screen shown below. Select the download mirror of
your choice.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/boost1.png" alt="Mirror selection"></p>

<p>The next step asks you to select the binaries to download. Since we
are using Visual Studio 2008, we will select this version in the left
panel; select the appropriate version if you're using an earlier
IDE. In the right panel, select Multithread, Multithread Debug,
Multithread static runtime, and Multithread Debug static runtime (the
others are not needed by QuantLib, but you might want to download them
anyway.) The resulting screen is shown below.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/boost2.png" alt="Version selection"></p>

<p>The next window asks you which libraries you'd like to install. You
can add any library that you want besides the ones selected by
default; the one needed for a complete QuantLib build is the unit test
framework, which can be found at the end of the list. The
corresponding screen follows.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/boost3.png" alt="Default library selection"></p>

<p>Choose the VC9.0 version (or the one corresponding to your IDE) to
include the unit test framework. You can also open the VC9.0 list and
select specific build versions.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/boost3A.png" alt="Library selection"></p>

<p>The next step asks for a destination folder. I will install
everything in a folder called <tt>Boost</tt> on my
<tt>C:</tt> drive. Feel free to choose your own folder.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/boost4.png" alt="Install location"></p>

<p>Clicking Install starts the download, which takes a while. After
finishing, the final screen should say:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/boost5.png" alt="Boost installed"></p>

<h2>Boost Configuration</h2>

<p>Before proceeding, we will make the Boost headers and libraries
available to all C++ projects. This allows us to make changes in only
one place after updating Boost. To do this, open Visual Studio without
a project and go to <i>Tools/Options</i> in the upper menu.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/qlA1.png" alt="VC options"></p>

<p>Go to <i>Projects and Solutions/VC++ Directories</i> in the
left-side tree, and choose <i>Include files</i> in the <i>Show
directories for:</i> drop-down menu on the upper right.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/qlA2.png" alt="directories dialog"></p>

<p>Include the Boost folder, in our case <tt>C:\Boost\boost_1_39</tt>.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/qlA3.png" alt="Include boost dir"></p>

<!--l. 225-->
<p>Go again to the <i>Show directories for:</i> drop-down menu and
choose <i>Library files</i>.

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/qlA4.png" alt="Library dirs"></p>

<p>Include the Boost library folder, in our
case <tt>C:\Boost\boost_1_39\lib</tt>. Click <i>OK</i>. You're done.
In case you run into problems afterwards, the Appendix shows how to
build a test program to check that Boost is correctly installed.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/qlA5.png" alt="Boost library dir"></p>


<h2>QuantLib Installation</h2>

<p>If you haven't downloaded QuantLib yet, go to its download page on
SourceForge, located
at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/quantlib/files/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/quantlib/files/.</a></p>

<p>Open the QuantLib tree, find the latest version (at the time of
this writing, 0.9.7; this might have changed when you read this) and
download the zip archive to your local drive. This is illustrated in
the screenshot below. Create a <tt>C:\QuantLib</tt> folder (or any
folder you want) and unzip the file in there, which will result in
a <tt>C:\QuantLib\QuantLib-0.9.7</tt> folder.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/ql1.png" alt="download QuantLib"></p>

<p>Enter the folder and open the Visual Studio solution
called <tt>QuantLib_vc9.sln</tt> by double clicking (use the solution
ending in <tt>_vc8</tt> or <tt>_vc7</tt> if you're using an earlier
IDE.)  As shown in the figure, choose <i>Release</i> from the
configuration menu in the toolbar.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/ql7.png" alt="QuantLib solution"></p>

<p>Right-click on the solution icon and choose <i>Build Solution</i>
to build all projects. Besides QuantLib, this will build the examples
and run the test suite. The building process takes a while. </p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/ql5.png" alt="Build solution"></p>

<p>After finishing, the output should show no errors.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/ql6.png" alt="Build output"></p>

<p>You are done with building QuantLib. If you want, you can build the
Debug version in the same way by choosing <i>Debug</i> from the
configuration menu as shown below. This will allow you to debug your
application later.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/ql12.png" alt="Debug version"></p>

<h2>Quantlib Usage</h2>

<p>As an example of QuantLib usage, I create
a <span class="cmti-9">QuantLibTest </span>folder in
the <tt>C:\QuantLib</tt> folder and set up a Win32 Console Application
in Visual Studio by clicking <i>File/New Project/Visual C++/Win32
Console Application</i>.</p>

<p>I've chosen the project name <tt>TestingQuantLib</tt>. Choose, for
example, the Release mode for that project.  Note that very often,
users don't setup a project correctly since they build QuantLib in one
mode and try to call it from a test programm which runs in some other
mode.  If you build in QuantLib in release mode, you should build
your project in release mode. If you build your project in debug mode
without ever building QuantLib in debug mode, you'll have link
errors.</p>

<p>To tell your project where to find QuantLib, open the project
properties, go to <i>Configuration Properties/C/C++/General/Additional
Include Directories</i> and enter the QuantLib path, which
is <tt>C:\QuantLib\QuantLib-0.9.7</tt>.</p>

<p>You don't need to do anything here regarding Boost, since you have
added its paths to the general options before.</p>

<p>The result should be as shown below.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/ql8.png" alt="QuantLib include directory"></p>

<p>Finally, go to <i>Configuration Properties/Linker/General/Additional Library Directories</i> and add <tt>C:\QuantLib\QuantLib-0.9.7\lib</tt> (see figure below.) Click <i>OK</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/ql9.png" alt="QuantLib library dir"></p>

<p>To test if the setup works, input the following main program in
the <tt>TestingQuantLib</tt> project. The program tests some Date and
Calendar classes.</p>

<pre>
// TestingQuantLib.cpp : Defines the entry point for the console application.
//

#include "stdafx.h"

#include &lt;ql/quantlib.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;


int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])
{
        QuantLib::Calendar myCal=QuantLib::UnitedKingdom();
        QuantLib::Date newYearsEve(31,QuantLib::Dec,2008);

        std::cout << "Name: "                       << myCal.name()<< std::endl;
        std::cout << "New Year is Holiday: "        << myCal.isHoliday(newYearsEve)<< std::endl;
        std::cout << "New Year is Business Day: "   << myCal.isBusinessDay(newYearsEve)<< std::endl;

        std::cout << "--------------- Date Counter --------------------" << std::endl;

        QuantLib::Date date1(28,QuantLib::Dec,2008);
        QuantLib::Date date2(04,QuantLib::Jan,2009);

        std::cout << "First Date: "            << date1 << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Second Date: "           << date2 << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Business Days Betweeen: "<< myCal.businessDaysBetween(date1,date2) << std::endl;
        std::cout << "End of Month 1. Date: "  << myCal.endOfMonth(date1) << std::endl;
        std::cout << "End of Month 2. Date: "  << myCal.endOfMonth(date2) << std::endl;

        return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>The output of the program should be:</p>
<pre>
<p>
Name: UK settlement
New Year is Holiday: 0
New Year is Business Day: 1
--------------- Date Counter --------------------
First Date: December 28th, 2008
Second Date: January 4th, 2009
Business Days Betweeen: 4
End of Month 1. Date: December 31st, 2008
End of Month 2. Date: January 30th, 2009
</pre>

<p>A last thing: If you see some warnings after building, to get rid
of them open the project properties again, go to <i>Configuration
Properties/C/C++/Preprocessor/Preprocessor Definitions</i> and
add <tt>_SCL_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE</tt>
and <tt>_CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE</tt> to the definitions, as shown
below.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/ql10.png" alt="Preprocessor defs"></p>

<p>Now, building the <tt>TestingQuantLib</tt> project again shouldn't
show you any warnings anymore, just as in the Output below. We're
done!</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/ql11.png" alt="Test output"></p>


<h2>Appendix: Manual Boost Installation</h2>

To build Boost manually, download the zip archive of the latest Boost release from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/</a>.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/boostA1.png" alt="Boost download"></p>

<p>In addition, download the latest Boost Jam from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-jam/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-jam/</a>.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/boostA2.png" alt="Boost-Jam download"></p>

<p>Unzip the Boost zip archive in the folder <tt>C:\Boost</tt>. You
will then have a directory called <tt>C:\Boost\boost_1_39_0</tt>
(depending on the version of the latest release.)</p>

<p>Unzip the Boost Jam zip archive in the
folder <tt>C:\Boost</tt>. You will then have a directory
called <tt>C:\Boost\boost-jam-3.1.17-1-ntx86</tt>. Go into this
directory and copy the file called <tt>bjam.exe</tt>. Go back
to <tt>C:\Boost\boost_1_39_0</tt> and paste <tt>bjam.exe</tt>.</p>

<p>Now, open Visual Studio without any project and go
to <i>Tools/Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt</i> in the upper
menu.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/boostA3.png" alt="open command prompt"></p>

<p>This will open a window. In the window, paste</p>
<pre>
cd C:\Boost\boost_1_39_0
</pre>
<p>to change the directory to your Boost folder (if you're not
building release 1.39, modify the above accordingly.) The result
should look similar to the window shown below. </p>

<p class="center"><img src="pics/vc9/boostA4.png" alt="command prompt"></p>

<!--l. 573-->
<p>Now start bjam by pasting</p>
<pre>
bjam --build-type=complete --toolset=msvc install
</pre>
<p>into the DOS window. Press enter. Depending on the daytime of your
installation, get a tea or a drink, as the above command will take a
few hours to finish.</p>

<p>After the compilation, setup your IDE to use Boost as described in
the <i>Boost configuration</i> section above.</p>

<h2>Appendix: Boost Usage</h2>
<p>To check that Boost was successfully installed, set up a Win32
Console Application in Visual Studio by clicking <i>File/New
Project/Visual C++/Win32 Console Application</i>.</p>

<p>I created the project in a folder called <tt>BoostTest</tt> in
the <tt>C:\Boost</tt> folder. The project name
is <tt>TestingBoost</tt>. Since you should have included the Boost
directories in the global IDE option, no further configuration should
be necessary.</p>

<p>Paste the following test program in the file with the main
function, in our case <tt>TestingBoost.cpp</tt>. The program shows
Boost's
<tt>FOR_EACH</tt> functionality.</p>

<pre>
// TestingBoost.cpp : Defines the entry point for the console application.
//

#include "stdafx.h"

#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

#include &lt;boost/foreach.hpp&gt;

int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])
{
        std::vector&lt;double&gt; myVec(5);

        myVec[0]=0.0;
        myVec[1]=0.1;
        myVec[2]=0.2;
        myVec[3]=0.3;
        myVec[4]=0.4;

        std::cout << "--- Vector For Each ---" << std::endl;
        BOOST_FOREACH(double x, myVec){
                std::cout << x << std::endl;
        }

        return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>The output of the program should be</p>
<pre>
--- Vector For Each ---
0
0.1
0.2
0.3
0.4
</pre>
